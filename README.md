# OpenAPI Generator for the Golang

This is a plugin for the official [OpenAPI
Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) generator. It
generates a Golang http server based on OpenAPI specification. 

The generated boilerplate project uses the following dependencies:

- [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [schema](https://github.com/phogolabs/schema)
- [rest](https://github.com/phogolabs/rest)

## What's OpenAPI

The goal of OpenAPI is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to
REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the
capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or
through network traffic inspection.  When properly described with OpenAPI, a
consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal
amount of implementation logic.

Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI
removes the guesswork in calling the service.

Check out [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for
additional information about the OpenAPI project, including additional
libraries with support for other languages and more.
